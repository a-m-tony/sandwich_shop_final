## Style, Design, and Features

* **Framework:** Flutter
* **State Management:** Provider
* **UI:**
    * A main screen for ordering sandwiches.
    * A dropdown for selecting the sandwich type.
    * A toggle for selecting the sandwich size (six-inch or footlong).
    * A dropdown for selecting the bread type.
    * A quantity selector.
    * An "Add to Cart" button.
    * A cart icon that displays the number of items in the cart.

## Current Task: Add individual image declarations to pubspec.yaml

* **Goal:** Add `veggieDelight_footlong.png` and `veggieDelight_sixinch.png` to the `assets` section of `pubspec.yaml`.
* **Plan:**
    1.  Modify `pubspec.yaml` to include the individual image declarations.
    2.  Run `flutter pub get` to update the project.
