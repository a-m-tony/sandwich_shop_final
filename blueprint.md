# Sandwich Shop App Blueprint

## Project Overview

A Flutter application that allows users to build and customize their own sandwiches.

## Implemented Features

*   **Home Page:** A landing page with a welcome message and a button to start building a sandwich.
*   **Sandwich Builder Page:** A new screen for building the sandwich (currently a placeholder).
*   **Navigation:** Basic navigation between the home page and the sandwich builder page.
*   **Project Structure:** 
    *   `assets/images`: Folder for storing images.
    *   `lib/models/sandwich.dart`: Data model for a sandwich.
    *   `lib/views/sandwich_builder_page.dart`: The UI for the sandwich builder.

## Current Plan

1.  **Flesh out the Sandwich Builder Page:**
    *   Add UI elements for selecting bread, ingredients, and sauces.
    *   Use the `Sandwich` model to manage the state of the sandwich being built.
2.  **Display Sandwich Image:**
    *   Add an image to the home page.
3.  **Improve Theming and Styling:**
    *   Apply a consistent and visually appealing theme to the application.
